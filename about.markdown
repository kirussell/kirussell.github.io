Hi, I’m Ruslan Kim, a Software Engineer with a passion for Mobile development. 
<br />
I currently work at Google, where I’m part of the team that develops the Pixel Watch line of smartwatches. 
<br />
Before that, I worked at Oculus, where I contributed to the Quest devices and RayBan Stories, the first smart glasses from Facebook.

<br />
<br />
I have two kids and a wife, who are my biggest supporters and inspirations. We lived in Russia, Singapore and California, Bay Area. 
<br />
Now I’m based in Austin, Texas, where I love the vibrant tech scene and the warm weather, + good schools and affordable housing.
<br />
In my spare time, I enjoy playing music, especially guitar, and experimenting with 3D printing.
